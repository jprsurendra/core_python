1. What is NumPy?
    Imagine you’re running a warehouse. You store lots of similar items (like boxes of apples).

    If you store them randomly on shelves, you’ll waste time searching and counting (like normal Python lists).

    But if you store them in a neat grid (like in a well-arranged warehouse), you can quickly count, move, and process them.

    This well-arranged warehouse = NumPy array (ndarray).

2. Why NumPy? (Compared to Lists)
    Normal lists are like a messy shopping cart—you check each item one by one.

    NumPy arrays are like a conveyor belt in an Amazon warehouse—organized, super-fast, and can handle bulk operations at once.

3. Creating Arrays  '''

a = np.array([1, 2, 3])

'''     
    Analogy:
        Think of np.array() as packing apples into a box.
        
        [1,2,3] is a loose bunch of apples.
        
        np.array() packs them into a box with structure.
        
        Memory Hook:
        
        array() = Arrange into an array (sounds like "array" → "arrange").     

4. Shapes & Dimensions
    1D array: Like a single row of lockers.

    2D array: Like rows and columns in a table.

    3D array: Like a Rubik’s cube (shelves with rows and columns).

    Think: Rows = horizontal shelves, Columns = vertical stacks.
    Memory trick: "Shape tells you the layout."
